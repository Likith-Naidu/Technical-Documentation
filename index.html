                    <code>Object-oriented programming (OOPS)</code> <br>
                    Object-oriented programming combines a group of data attributes with functions or methods into a
                    unit called an "object." Typically, OOP languages are class-based, which means that a class defines
                    the data attributes and functions as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the
                    class. Popular class-based OOP languages include Java, Python, and C++. Multiple independent objects
                    may be instantiated—or represented—from the same class and interact with each other in complex
                    ways.<br>
                    A simple example would be a class representing a person. The person class would contain attributes
                    to
                    represent information such as the person’s age, name, height, etc. The class definition might also
                    contain
                    functions such as "sayMyName" which would simply print that person’s name to the screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A family could be constructed by instantiating person objects from the class for each member of the
                    family.
                    Each person object would contain different data attributes since each person is unique.<br>

                    This programming style is pervasive in popular programming languages such as Java, C++, Python,
                    JavaScript
                    and C# among others. By defining sets of classes that represent and encapsulate objects in a
                    program, the classes
                    can be organized into modules, improving the structure and organization of software programs. Thus,
                    developers
                    often use OOP as a tool when they need to create complex programs since they are easier to reason in
                    terms of
                    classes and their relationships.

                <p>
                    <code>The word, “encapsulate,” means to enclose something. Just like a pill "encapsulates" or contains 
                        the medication inside of its coating, the principle of encapsulation works in a similar way in OOP: 
                        by forming a protective barrier around the information contained within a class from the rest of 
                        the code.</code> <br>
                    In OOP, we encapsulate by binding the data and functions which operate on that data into a single
                    unit,
                    the class. By doing so, we can hide private details of a class from the outside world and only
                    expose
                    functionality that is important for interfacing with it. When a class does not allow calling code
                    access
                    to its private data directly, we say that it is well encapsulated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: Elaborating on the person class example from earlier, we might have private data in the
                    class, such
                    as "socialSecurityNumber," that should not be exposed to other objects in the program. By
                    encapsulating this
                    data member as a private variable in the class, outside code would not have direct access to it, and
                    it would
                    remain safe within that person’s object. <br>

                    If a method is written in the person class to perform, say, a bank transaction called
                    "bankTransaction(),"
                    that function could then access the "socialSecurityNumber" variable as necessary. The person’s
                    private data
                    would be well encapsulated in such a class.

                <p>
                    <code>Often, it’s easier to reason and design a program when you can separate the interface of a class from 
                        its implementation, and focus on the interface. This is akin to treating a system as a “black box,” where 
                        it’s not important to understand the gory inner workings in order to reap the benefits of using it.</code>
                    This process is called “abstraction” in OOP, because we are abstracting away the gory implementation
                    details
                    of a class and only presenting a clean and easy-to-use interface via the class’ member functions.
                    Carefully
                    used, abstraction helps isolate the impact of changes made to the code, so that if something goes
                    wrong,
                    the change will only affect the implementation details of a class and not the outside code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: Think of a stereo system as an object with a complex logic board on the inside. It has
                    buttons on the
                    outside to allow for interaction with the object. When you press any of the buttons, you're not
                    thinking about what
                    happens on the inside because you can't see it. Even though you can't see the logic board completing
                    these functions
                    as a result of pressing a button, it's still performing them., albeit hidden to you. <br>

                    This is the concept of abstraction, which is incredibly useful in all areas of engineering and also
                    applied to great
                    effect in object-oriented programming.

                <p>
                    <code>Object-oriented languages that support classes almost always support the notion of “inheritance.” Classes can 
                        be organized into hierarchies, where a class might have one or more parent or child classes. If a class has
                         a parent class, we say it is derived or inherited from the parent class and it represents an “IS-A” type relationship.
                          That is to say, the child class “IS-A” type of the parent class.</code>
                    Therefore, if a class inherits from another class, it automatically obtains a lot of the same
                    functionality and
                    properties from that class and can be extended to contain separate code and data. A nice feature of
                    inheritance is
                    that it often leads to good code reuse since a parent class’ functions don’t need to be re-defined
                    in any of its child
                    classes. <br>

                    Consider two classes: one being the superclass—or parent—and the other being the subclass—or child.
                    The child class
                    will inherit the properties of the parent class, possibly modifying or extending its behavior.
                    Programmers applying the
                    technique of inheritance arrange these classes into what is called an “IS-A” type of relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Example: For instance, in the animal world, an insect could be represented by an Insect superclass.
                    All insects share
                    similar properties, such as having six legs and an exoskeleton. Subclasses might be defined for
                    grasshoppers and ants.
                    Because they inherit or are derived from the Insect class, they automatically share all insect
                    properties.
                </p>

                <header>Polymorphism</header>
                <p>
                    <code>In OOP, polymorphism allows for the uniform treatment of classes in a hierarchy. Therefore, calling code 
                        only needs to be written to handle objects from the root of the hierarchy, and any object instantiated by any 
                        child class in the hierarchy will be handled in the same way.</code>
                    Because derived objects share the same interface as their parents, the calling code can call any
                    function in that
                    class’ interface. At run-time, the appropriate function will be called depending on the type of
                    object passed
                    leading to possibly different behaviors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Example: Suppose we have a class called, “Animal” and two child classes, “Cat,” and “Dog.” If the
                    Animal class has
                    a method to make a noise, called, “makeNoise,” then, we can override the "makeNoise" function that
                    is inherited by
                    the sub-classes, "Cat" and "Dog," to be “meow” and “bark,” respectively. Another function can, then,
                    be written that
                    accepts any Animal object as a parameter and invokes its "makeNoise" member function. The noise will
                    be different:
                    either a “meow” or a “bark” depending on the type of animal object that was actually passed to the
                    function.
